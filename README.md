# Burger_Meister
 A full-stack app hosted on heroku that utilizes:
* Node.js
* Express
* MySql
* Handlebars
## How it works
1. The user is presented a basic html page that provides a list of Uneaten Burgers, and Eaten Burgers, as well as a form for submitting new burgers they desire to eat in the future.
1. Each Uneaten Burger is accompanied by a button to "Eat ze burger" that moves said burger from the uneaten list to the eaten list.
